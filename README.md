What's New:
- Another server can't see the task that inserted from another server (e.g Task that inserted from Server A can't be accessed from Server B using command t!all)
- Disable Update and Delete feature (Because updating task is more time consuming than reinsert task and if you want to delete task just use "X" reaction below respective task)
